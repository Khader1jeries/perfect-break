# Contributing to Perfect Break

Thanks for helping! This project is public and non‑profit.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo, create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/<short-name>`
2. Make changes with clear commits (we prefer Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
3. Ensure lint/tests pass (CI will run).
4. Open a Pull Request. Link any related issue.

## Code style
- TypeScript strict mode for web/api.
- Keep functions small; write docs for non‑obvious logic.
- Prefer server pagination and indexed queries.

## Issues
- Use the templates (Bug/Feature).
- Add labels: `good first issue`, `help wanted` to invite newcomers.

## Community
Be kind. See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
